🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate Hacker from Poland with a deep interest in Cybersecurity and Professional Programming.

My journey focuses on mastering ethical hacking techniques, penetration testing, and building robust applications (mostly using Python). I aim to code like a professional programmer in every project.

I actively develop projects on GitHub and share my findings and experiences on YouTube.
